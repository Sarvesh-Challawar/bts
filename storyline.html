				<b><u>BTS universe</u></b>

				<p>We call the BTS storyline to be set up in the Bangtan Universe. An alternate universe where BTS members are the characters but living different lives. Imagine it as something like a fan fiction, but BTS were the creators instead.</p>

				<p>Bangtan Universe can include events that happened in their music videos, some songs, concept photos, teaser trailers, choreography, 화양연화: The Notes, Smeraldo Blog, things BTS says in their interviews and stories that inspire them. (Don’t fret I’ll explain each of these one by one.)</p>

				<p>When it comes to Bangtan Universe, there is no limitation to the story. Since BTS has literally never given us a right answer to the events, we can interpret it as many ways as possible. I’m saying this because if you ever watch/read theories about Bangtan Universe and see fan theorists arrive to different conclusions, don’t get confused. We all have different ways in perceiving how events go and your task is to believe whatever theory fits more for you.</p>

				<b>BANGTAN UNIVERSE</b>

				It’s important to note that Bangtan Universe is <i>not real</i>. The events that happen there are all imaginary, make belief and just a story.

				<u>Note:</u> I won’t be explaining each theory because that is 5 years worth of BTS’ career and I simply don’t have time to do so >,<

				<p><u>Music Videos:</u> Their music videos are independent in some ways but there’s always a link that connects one to another. In fact, all their music videos have a storyline, but it’s in your best interest to decipher whether the two MVs are connected or not. If you want to understand the storyline best, these are the core music videos to analyze:
				I Need U Original Version
				Run
				Young Forever
				Fire
				Blood Sweat & Tears
				Spring Day
				Not Today
				DNA
				Euphoria
				Singularity
				Fake Love & FL Extended Version
				Epiphany</p>

				<p><u>Songs:</u> Some lyrics to their songs are also riddled with Bangtan Universe but remember that their songs are also highly parallel to their real life experiences so tread it carefully. In songs, they usually drop hints of the next album concept and what inspired them to write such lyrics. I would argue though that it is more authentic to interpret their songs reality based and not fiction based.

				<p><u>Concept Photos:</u> These are teaser pictures of what you can expect in the album photobook. A lot of ARMYs has now started theorizing their concept photos as well.
				Example of this is S,E,L,F concept photos for Love Yourself: Answer. ‘S’ being the most controversial as you can see them trapped inside a red box with hands trying to touch them, cameras pointing at them and eyes looking at them. This is like a representation of what their life is in general, they are trapped in the borders of celebrity life stripped off of their right to privacy because one would argue that they are ‘public figures’.</p>

				<p><u>Teaser Trailers:</u> I think teaser trailers are more of a gift to the fans because BTS knows how much we enjoy analyzing the storyline. Here are the major ones to watch:
				The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Prologue
				Wings Short Film (each member)
				The Wings Tour Trailer
				Highlight Reels
				Theme of Love Yourself Wonder: Euphoria</p>

				<p><u>Choreography:</u> It’s mostly independent on each songs and really just how they interpret the song through performance.
				Example: “See no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil” choreo in Fake Love where they cover their eyes, ears and mouth to represent the saying.</p>

				<p><u>화양연화: The Notes:</u> (화양연화 = reads as Hwa Yang Yeon Hwa, HYYH, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life). This started during Love Yourself Era, wherein each member has written some kind of a journal entry explaining what happened in 화양연화 Era. This era includes: 화양연화 Part 1, Part 2 and Young Forever Trilogy Albums. This is fake, and solely just a part of Bangtan Universe.

				<p><u>Smeraldo Blog:</u> This is a fake blog created by Big Hit to further push the BTS storyline. Smeraldo is a fictional flower that was derived from the story ‘La Cittá di Smeraldo’. In the highlight reels, you would see Jin holding a bouquet of Smeraldo Flowers.
				Link to the blog: :: Flower Smeraldo :: : 네이버 블로그. Everything is written in Korean so you’d have to manually search translations but don’t worry because ARMY translators are hardworking.
				Read on the origin of Smeraldo: Legend of the smeraldo flower – Indrachapa S J – Medium</p>

				<p><u>Things BTS say on interviews:</u> Sometimes they drop hints on books they are reading and what may have inspired their songs so it’s important to pay close attention.
				Example: Namjoon has stated in an interview before that he’s reading Demian and that is the book that inspired the storyline in Blood Sweat and Tears.
				I only touched the surface of Bangtan Universe because it is a broad topic to begin with—so how you interpret it, is up to you. Watch a lot of theories in youtube, also research is the key if you want to understand everything about it! Good luck and happy reading! :)</p>
