2 Cool 4 Skool

We are Bulletproof pt.2
	The name is Jungkook, my scale is nationwide(play on words)
	I pulled all-nighters at practice rooms instead of school, dancing and singing
	When you guys partied, I gave up sleep for my dreams

	All you who are called rappers because you can't sing,
	the rapper title is an extravagance for you

	Everywhere I go, everything I do
	I will show you as much as I sharpened my sword
	To all the people who looked down on me, oh oh oh oh oh oh, hey shout it out

	Oh! Throw a stone at me if you've done as much as I did
	We go hard, we have no fear(Click click, bang bang)
	We juss sing it like(Click click, bang bang)

	Rap monster, like my name, I can eat up any kind of beat like a monster
	I am loyal to my name. Hey guys, come here, take a preview, I put a twist to being an idol, Haha
	Hyungs who are only full of their hip-hop pride told me it’s impossible, but
	look carefully at me, placing a period on impossible
	I’m possible– Is it good now, boy?

No more dream
	I wanna big house, big cars & big rings
	But actually, I don’t have any big dreams

	What is the you that you’ve dreamed of?
	Who do you see in the mirror? I gotta say
	Go on your path, even if you live for a day
	Do something, put away your weakness

	Sick of the same day, the repeating days
	Adults and my parents keep telling me the same dreams
	The number one future career is a government worker?
	It’s not a forced dream, a ninth inning relief pitcher throw a fast ball

	Throw a fast ball at the waste of time that is night study sessions
	Rebel against the hell-like society, ignore the dreams
	Ask yourself about your dream profile
	Become the main subject of your life that has always been held back

	That's a lie, you such a liar
	See me, see me ya, you're such a hypocrite
	Why're you telling to go a different path?
	Take care of yourself, please don't force me

O!RUL8,2?
---------
N.O.
	A good house, a good car, will these things bring happiness?
	In Seoul to the SKY, will parents really be happy?

	Dreams disappeared, there was no time to rest
	It’s a cycle of school, home or an Internet cafe
	Everyone lives the same life
	Students who are pressured to be number one live in between dreams and reality
	 
	Who is the one who made us into studying machines?
	They classify us to either being number one or dropping out
	They trap us in borders, the adults
	There’s no choice but to consent
	Even if we think simply, it’s the survival of the fittest
	Who do you think is the one who makes us step on even our close friends to climb up? What?
	 
	Adults tell me that hardships are only momentary
	To endure a little more, to do it later
	 
	Everybody say NO!
	It can’t be any later
	Don’t be trapped in someone else’s dream
	We roll (We roll) We roll (We roll) We roll

	The grown-ups confess that we have it so easy
	They say that we are happier than our portion
	Then how do you explain my unhappiness?
	There’s no conversation topics beside studying
	Outside, there are so many kids like me, living the life of a puppet
	Who will take responsibility?

We On
	You guys only see what
	you want to see anyway

	Big Hit and Bulletproof Boy Scouts,
	yeah I’m makin’ em shine

BTS Cypher pt.1
	Damn the hip-hop pride, idol rapper? Cut that bullshit
	He’s essentially an idol shit anyway – they look down on me
	They give their principles to the dogs and laugh at my name

	So I bring the monster back
	My monster swag
	So this is the monster track
	Cuz of my freakin’ monster rap

	I was always generous
	But now I’mma murder you rappers
	Cut em up by order
	Then I’mma murder you haters
	Now look at me and tell me, who’s in your top 5?
	Rap Monster, Randa, Rida, Rapmon, your dad

	I have yet to go to the army but my hobby is sharpshooting
	We are bulletproof was a big hit

	I’m dope man, I’m the Chopin of the beat
	I won’t ever change, I was born a rapper
	My attitude is my mentor
	Even if you talk smack about me, I’m memento

	Show your hip-hop pride but you’ll still feel impotent
	Hide your jealousy, I can see your IP address
	I’m a boiler, I get hot in an instant
	Like a spoiler, you’re so typical

Attack on Bangtan
	Are you all ready to go crazy
	Are you ready to run as fast as you can
	Tighten your stomach and take a deep breath
	Are you all ready to go crazy
	Are you ready to run as fast as you can
	If you are then, right now, scream!

	Who are we? The rising Bulletproof Boy Scouts
	Who are we? We swallow them all up without fear
	Cuz we got fire, fire fire
	Get higher, higher higher
	If you don’t know us, then take a good look
	Who are we? Who? The rise of Bangtan

	The moment we step on stage
	I hear the sound of your screams
	Just stay there like that forever,
	Because even if I die now,
	I won’t have any regrets

Skool Luv Affair
----------------
Boy in luv
	I want to be your oppa
	I’m so hungry for your love
	I want to be your oppa
	I’ll have you, just watch

	Why are you shaking up my heart?
	Why are you shaking up my heart?
	Why are you shaking up my heart?
	Shaking up,
	shaking up

	Just how exactly did dad
	ask mom out? Should I write you
	a letter? What is this? I become
	like dust in front of you

	If it’s with you, I think
	I can go to a good college
	ABCDEFGH Hakuna Matata
	Your profile picture is the same
	but why do I keep checking it?
	But don’t misunderstand,
	I’m not an easy guy

	How should I change for you?
	Playing mind games? Two-timing?
	I don’t know how to do that
	But if you’re ever sick,
	don’t call 911 but call me
	Tell me to cry, I’ll cry, tell me to smile,
	I’ll smile, tell me to roll around,
	I’ll roll around

Just one day
	If only I had just one day
	I want to peacefully fall asleep intoxicated with your sweet scent
	If there’s a chance in my busy schedule
	I want to put my body in your warm and deep eyes

	Wherever we go, my handbag is your waist
	Yo ma honey, whenever I see you, I run out of breath
	Like the streets of Myungdong, our BGM is the sound of breathing
	Your voice when you say my name

	I appreciate the masterpiece that is you because your existence alone is art
	I imagine this all night every day because it’s a meaningless dream anyway

	I’ll pick one and tell it to you for sure
	Let’s meet when the lilies bloom and say goodbye when they wither
	I didn’t think I’d get over you easily but
	Is it selfish of me to hope you are the same?
	I’m still lying, saying that it’s all for you
	You are standing in the center of my life

	“If I have just one day, it’s possible”

	If only we can be together
	Can you please stay with me?

//Tomorrow


BTS Cypher pt.2(Triptych)
	Bang Tan cypher right here, psycho right here
	Whoever's in the ring, we'll win, rap fighter right here
	I'll say hi, you'll say bye, a burnt tire, we're different
	Fire, hot choir, captivating K-Pop like PSY

	I'm a rap wiper, a complete psycho, if I'm a dicer,
	Then I have all the dice
	Cypher, if you're nice, I'm nicer
	If you're Pride, then I'm a Chrysler,
	That means I'mma priceless
	Who are you to judge my rap? Rapper?

	This is One Piece, I'm a Whitebeard,
	You just have long beards like catfish

	I put the whole world on my tongue
	I play with big boys, I ain't spittin low sh
	On the CD or the TV, you can see me,
	Envy me, it's a pity, gee gee

	I'mma monster I rap with a prospect,
	Yeah I rap with a mindset I'm a suspect
	Sucka where yo rhymes at where you lines at?
	I'm da king, I'm the god
	So where ma emperors at?
	I parachute on my Neverland,
	I'mma peter pan, so this will never end
	You know when I ride on my G5
	You sit first class and satisfy and I keep giggling
	Keep gigglin, keep jigglin,

	You old caterpillars,
	I'll give you this beat, give it a try
	Hey, start talking when you can start rapping
	There should be a law restricting you from rapping

	My domain is dopeman.com, scolded many with a mic
	Speech and action are like shackles,
	My crime is assault with my tongue

	When you were playing underground,
	BTS was playing at ground level
	Compared to you who sleeps all night,
	I'm a workaholic, shoppaholic

	Overspending on my pens that are more in number than
	Your fans, if I go all in and shoot, it's a goal in
	Goal in, I'm ballin, when I hear your rap,
	I'm about to throw up

	You think being escorted makes you powerful,
	I hope you put down your mic
	If I'm the sun, you're the moon,
	Because when I rise, you go down

	All you hip-hip designer brand bastards,
	Come down from the foamy bubbles
	Hey you brats, your crappy rap is a burden to others
	Take a break and wait, just go to Hawaii, go home
	See how far I go, all the rotten roots will be replaced
	Everyone, let's play a game,
	Without efforts, you'll just be grieving
	You think you can do music?
	Just go look for a part-time job

	Compared to your size, your rap is so thin
	Like your parents, my heart hurts every time I see you
	I'll put a period at the artery of your music career
